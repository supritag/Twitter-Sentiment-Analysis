# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis

The dataset is from the recent [kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/tweet-sentiment-extraction/overview) where the objective is to classify the given tweet as positive, negative or neutral from labelled dataset. The secondary objective is to also return the text and its neighbourhood in the text to depict the sentiment.
We are focussing of the primary objective solely in this notebook and examining the effectiveness on using LSTM for text classification into the sentiments of the texts. 
We also attempt hyperparameter tuning to acheive satisfactory results on vectorized text using Word2vec method.
